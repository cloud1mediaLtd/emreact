# EM REACT Maintenance Services

We provide a reactive and planned range of maintenance services. Every client will be allocated an account manager who will be your initial point of contact. Our tailored service can suit your every need. We facilitate dealing with communal areas, tenanted, vacant, and probate properties. EM React Ltd has an extensive portfolio consisting of public and private sector clients.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
